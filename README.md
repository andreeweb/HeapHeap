# HeapHeap
Project for the Engineering course of the algorithms during the academic year 2014/2015.

# Description

Conduct an experimental investigation on the behavior of d-heap, for d = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 16, binomial heaps and binary heaps.

In particular are asked to compare the behavior of these data structures as a result of a random sequence of entries of integers and extractions of the minimum, studying the performance of algorithms to vary the total number of tasks (number of entries + number of extractions of the min).

Finally, she asked to compare the behavior of structures data considered in sorting applications (that is, if the different data structures are used within heapsort).
