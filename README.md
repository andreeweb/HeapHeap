# HeapHeap
Project for the Engineering course of the algorithms during the academic year 2014/2015.

# Description

Conduct an experimental investigation on the behavior of d-heap, for d = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 16, binomial heaps and binary heaps.

In particular are asked to compare the behavior of these data structures as a result of a random sequence of entries of integers and extractions of the minimum, studying the performance of algorithms to vary the total number of tasks (number of entries + number of extractions of the min).

Also compare the behavior of structures data considered in sorting applications using HeapSort.

# Usage

Download repo or clone it and type in command line:

```
python3 heapheap.py
```
# Plot!

At the end of each test (except for HeapSort) the program use lib [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) for plot the results, like this example:
